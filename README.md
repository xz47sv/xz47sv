## Hi there

- my site: https://ash.fail

## I am not active here and I only use github for submitting issues/pull requests!

The projects here, that are owned by me, are only mirrors.

All my personal projects can be found on:
- sourcehut: https://git.sr.ht/~ashie
- codeberg: https://codeberg.org/ashie

Posts neatly summarizing my feelings about github better than I ever could:
